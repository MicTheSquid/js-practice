Ollie's scared of everything.  Seriously.  One time I jokingly threw a [singular noun] at him and he cried for at least an hour.  And holy shit, he smells weird.  There's this perpetual scent of [type of cheese] that's been sitting out for days wafting off of him.  It's very clear he was never taught proper manners.  I mean, did his [family member] never teach him how to [plural verb] [plural noun]?  I hate that guy.  I really wish he would just [verb present tense].
